% 4  Results
% 4.1  Various plots with differing initial waves and bays ? including top-down view
% 4.1.1  Plots of same initial wave through different bays
% 4.1.1.1  Discuss resonance in terms of max. run up vs. max run up in plane-shaped bay (very large m)
% 4.1.1.1.1  Also in terms of how far up shore wave travels (top-down view)
% 4.1.2  Include at least one plot of eigenfunctions in both physical and sigma space
% 4.1.3  Include error in x wall mentioned previously in all different plots
% 4.2  Comparison to Pelinovsky?s analytic solution for m=2 and initial profile from paper
% 4.2.1  Comparison to initial condition
% 4.2.2  Alter number of eigenvalues, sigma (or x) steps, and lambda steps (each separately) to see what it takes to converge to analytic solution.
% 4.3  Possibly use max. run up and min. run down as a convergence metric - when varying number of eigenvalues, sigma (or x) steps, and lambda steps - for other values of m
% 4.4  Show how closely nonlinear system follows superposition principle ? measure of how linear/nonlinear the system is

		For a parabolic bay and the initial condition
		\[ \Phi(\sigma, \lambda_0) = A \guassian{\sigma - \sigma_0}{p} \]
		Pelinovsky and Didenkulova found an analytical solution
		\[
			\Phi(\sigma,\lambda) = 
		\frac{a}{\sigma} \left (
				\guassian{\sigma +\lambda -\sigma_0}{p} +
				\guassian{\sigma +\lambda +\sigma_0}{p}-
				\guassian{\sigma -\lambda -\sigma_0}{p} -
				\guassian{\sigma -\lambda +\sigma_0}{p}
			\right ) \]
		which we can compare our model against.
