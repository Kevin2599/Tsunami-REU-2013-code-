% 3  Our work
% 3.1  Discuss our specific problem which allows us to apply spectral methods
% 3.1.1  Boundary condition: shore condition and ?wall? at some distance L
% 3.1.1.1  This is a potential problem we must keep track of? eta must be close to zero to avoid significant error.
% 3.1.2  Mention physical examples where ?wall? could exist
% 3.1.2.1  Actual physical wall-like object: dam, glacier, cliff, steep mountain, anything steep enough that does not move can be approximated as a wall
% 3.1.2.2  Point that the wave passes through but does not alter height (analogous to point in the middle of 2 standing waves)
% 3.2  Go through spectral method for arbitrary m with Bessel solution.
% 3.3  Mention for m=2 this solution is simplified to sin solution
% 3.3.1  Still not fully analytic though because eigenvalues can only be found numerically
