% 1.1  Define tsunami wave (versus wind wave)
	\slide[Tsunami Waves] {
		They are long/shallow waves.
		
		In comparison to wind waves, which are short/deep

% 1.2  Purpose of our research
	\slide[Introduction to the Problem]{
		Mathematical modeling of tsunami run-up.
		\bi	\item Numerous real-world applications.
			\item Analytical solutions allow numerical solutions to be checked.
			\item Primarily involves solving non-linear partial differential equations.
		\ei
		Our REU program focused on
		\bi	\item Bays of trapezoidal cross-section.
			\item Initially we looked for an analytical solution.
			\item Unable to find one, so we mixed analytical and numerical techniques.
