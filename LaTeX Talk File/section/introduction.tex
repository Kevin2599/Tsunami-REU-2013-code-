	\slide [Introduction to the Bay Shapes]{
		In the field of Tsunami run-up research, there are several natural bay shapes to examine:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The plane beach;
			\item Bays of parabolic cross-section;
		\end{itemize}
		There has been extensive study of the plane beach and bays of parabolic cross-section, but tsunami behavior in bays of general U-shaped bays of finite length has not been examined.
		
		In each case, we assume that the bottom profile is separable: \emph{i.e.}
		\[   z(x,y) = f(y) - h(x)  \]
		where $z(x,y)$ is the bottom profile, $f(y)$ is an arbitrary function and $h(x)$ is an arbitrary non-negative function.

	\slide[The Plane Beach]{
		Characteristics of the plane beach:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Constant slope;
			\item Uniform across y-axis;
			\item Can be simplified to 2 dimensions.
		\end{itemize}
		This is the problem examined in the famous 1958 paper of Carrier and Greenspan.
		They showed that in this case, explicit solutions to the shallow water wave equations were possible.

	\slide[Bays of Parabolic Cross-section]{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{bay/parabolicbay.png}}

	\slide[Bays of Parabolic Cross-section]{
		Characteristics of bays of parabolic cross-section:
		Characteristics of bays of parabolic cross-section:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Constant slope;
			\item Parabolic cross-section along y-axis;
			\item Behavior of waves in such a channel can still be simplified to 2 dimensions.
		\end{itemize}
		This more complicated problem was analyzed in a recent paper by Dr. Ira Didenkulova and Dr. Efim Pelinovsky,
			in which they showed that it was possible to reduce this problem to one that is analogous to the 2-dimensional case,
			and thus analytical solutions are possible for the infinite length case.

	\slide[Bays of Trapezoidal Cross-section]{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{bay/trapezoidalbay.png}}

	\slide[Bays of Trapezoidal Cross-section]{
		Characteristics of bays of trapezoidal cross-section:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Constant slope
			\item Cross-section is determined by a symmetrical trapezoid\\
			slope of the walls is $\beta$\\
			distance across the base is $2 y_0$
			\item Behavior of waves in such a bay is unknown. 
		\end{itemize}
		These bays where the focus of the 2012 REU.

	\slide[Terminology]{
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $\eta(x,t)$ is the perturbation of water level at time $t$, distance $x$ from shore.
			\item $H(x,t)$ is the total water depth. Note: $H(x,t) = h(x) + \eta(x,t)$.
			\item $S(H)$ is the cross-sectional area of the bay. Note
				\[ S(H) = \int_0^{H(x,t)} f(y) \delta y \]
			\item $u(x,t)$ is the average water velocity on a cross-section perpendicular to the cross-section.
			\item We only consider $h(x) = -\alpha x$, where $\alpha$ is a non-negative constant. Since $x$ is typically negative in our domain, $h$ will usually be non-negative, and $H$ must always be non-negative.
		\end{itemize}
